# Week 1 Challenge
# Accesibility

# User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# What was done
The page was given a title
All images were given an alt description for accesibility 
HTML now follows a se,antic structure
CSS selectors and properties were consolidated

# The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:
